# Language Translation for Coastal Kannada

This repository consists of the work done during my Bachelor's Thesis along with my batchmates Namratha Karanth, Jaideep Francis Reddy and Stive Hassan. This work was done as part of the [Machine Learning and Blockchain Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Machine-Learning-and-Blockchain-Lab-Manjunath-R-Kounte) under the guidance of Dr Manjunath R Kounte. Our Paper can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352167205_Speech_Segmentation_with_Neural_Networks_to_Facilitate_Vernacular_Translation). The repository consists of all the code and the output file with the translation from English to Coastal Kannada. The repository will be updated regularly.
